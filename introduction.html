    <h1>Introduction about myself</h1>
      <h2>Common informations</h2>
      <p>I'm a 24 years old man, born and raised in the town of Nivelles, 30km south of Brussels. I live there, but that have not always been the case, i also lived in Brussels for a year and a half. I mainly use train and metro as transportation, so i any of you use the Brussels-Charleroi train line we may bump into each other while going to work.</p>
      <h2>Educationnal background</h2>
      <p>I had my CESS at the IPET of Nivelles, where i was in the IT section and learned about Python and a bit of SQL, HTMl and CSS. I then started studying computer sciences in Brussels at the HELB, but i stopped as it wasnt focus enough on programming, and most of the courses where about things i already learned in school or by myself. Worry not, i am not some kind of computer genius and have still a lot to learn, i'm just an IT enthusiast ! I also learned english by myself, and practiced  during my trips in england to visit my bestfriend.</p>
      <h2>Hobbys</h2>
      <p>My main hobbies are Roleplaying (like dungeon and dragon, but not that), boardgames and gardenning. You may be surprised but i'm an extrovert. I like to go out and meet new people, and i look forward to meeting all of you. Regarding roleplay, i'm not just a player, i am the game master, meaning that i'm the one who tells and write the story the players will adventure. Also, and that will not be a surprise when you look at my other hobbies, i like video games. Specifically strategy games and RPG.</p>
