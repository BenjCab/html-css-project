    <h1>Technical topic : Unity</h1>

    <p>Unity is a free develpment platform/game engine. It provides tools for developpers, allowing them to make games or apps easily.
    </div>
    <h2>When and for what?</h2>
    <p>Unity provide 2 different working environment : 2D and 3D. When you start developping a program using unity, the first step is to decide what to use. Unity may look fancy, you should be sure that it's adapted to the work you want to do before starting using it, as projects made with unity cant be changed in non-unity projects, so changing platform would mean to start over. </p>
    <h2>What does it do?</h2>
    <p>To put it simply : it provides you with a scene where you can place objects and link scripts to said objects. It also handle 'events' and this kind of stuff. For exemple if you want to create a simple mario game, the character creation is fairly easy : you just import an image of your character, select a hibox (yes, the engine will create a lot of background variables that you dont even have to worry about) and link a script for it's movement. But it's even better : the engine already handle gravity so you dont have to worry about thta either. </p>
    <p>Beware ! Yes it makes the programmer life easy, but it still requires strong notion in programming, it is not replacing you, it's just a tool that handle common game concepts (or 3d concepts, it has a large field of possibility). </p>
