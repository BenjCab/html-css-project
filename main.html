    <h1>My Presentation</h1>
    <p>This is a website that aims to present me. It's an exercise in HTML and CSS to apply the knowledge i have in this domain. </p>
    <p>The website is composed of 3  pages :
    <ul>
      <li><a href='main.html'>The home page</a>, that you are currently reading, wich is used as a hub for the website.</li>
      <li><a href='introduction.html'>The introduction page</a>, where you can read about myself (Educationnal background, hobbies, etc)</li>
      <li><a href="technical.html">The technical topic</a> that i'll be presenting</li>
    </ul>
    I know that this seemed like a repetition of the menu of the website, but please keep in mind that this is just to fill the website with content, i might as well have used lorem ipsum.
    </p>
    <p> I hope that you will find my website pleasant and well organized. If you need to contact me, my infos are on the introduction page.</p>

    <footer>
      This is a footer, it has no other purpose than being a footer to add some content to the website and look pretty.
